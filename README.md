# UWindsor CSS Discord Bot

## **THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

**By contributing to this software in any way, you agree to the terms laid out in CONTRIBUTING.md**

_Warning: This bot was designed to work on Unix-based OS'._
_Your milage may vary and it may be a nightmare to install without Docker on Windows._

## Setting Up the Configuration

Copy the `config.example.yaml` file to `config.yaml`. You can do this with `cp config.example.conf config.conf`.

Once you've copied your config, you'll need to configure it to work with the Discord API.

### Configuring the Bot

##### Connecting with the Discord API

- `api_token`: the token for your Bot User from the Bot section of the Discord Developer Portal.
- `api_client_id`: the Client ID from the Application page of the Discord Developer Portal.
- `bot_user_id`: the "permission integer", usually 8 (administrator).
- `debug`: when true, extra messages will be logged in the terminal to aid debugging.
- `development_guild_id`: the ID of the server you want the bot to register commands in while developing. This allows faster iteration as commands can take up to an hour to register globally.

##### Customizing the Commands

- `prompt.channel`: The ID of the channel to send prompts to
- `prompt.top_text`: a prefix to put on all prompts
- `prompt.bottom_text`: a postfix to put on all prompts
- `features`: a map of commands to enable

## Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies

- Docker

### Developer Dependencies

- prettier latest version
- yarn latest version
- node.js v16.13.1

## Developing Locally

In development you don't need to [build and run a docker image](#build-and-run-with-docker) if you have all the dependencies: 

1. `yarn` to install packages
2. `yarn start` to run the bot

## Build and Run with Docker

1. Build a docker image: `docker build -t CssBot .`
2. You can choose to run the bot detached (in the background) or not.
   - **Detached**: `docker run -d CssBot`
   - **Not Detached**: `docker run CssBot`


### Stopping a Detached Bot

You need the container ID, which can be found with `docker ps`, under the first column.

You can then stop the bot with `docker stop <container id>`.
